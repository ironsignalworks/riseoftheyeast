Perfect choice. **"Rise of the Yeast"** is catchy, thematic, and hilarious. Below is your **game concept document** with full flavor and game flow based on the tower defense protocol you liked:

## 🎮 **Game Title:**

## **Rise of the Yeast**

**Genre:**
🍞 Tower Defense / Resource Management

**Style:**
🥬 2D Cartoon Aesthetic – think microbial *Plants vs. Zombies* meets *Adventure Time*.

**Tone:**
🦠 Whimsical, pun-heavy, mildly gross (but cute).

---

## 🧠 **Core Concept:**

The fermented are rising. Yeast colonies must defend the kitchen ecosystem from an outbreak of moldy mutants, bad bacteria, and rogue fungi. Defend your turf—*from countertop to cryo-chamber*—in this chaotic microbial turf war.

## 🧪 **Core Mechanics:**

### 🧂 **Resources:**

### 🧟 **Enemies (Spoilage Horde):**

Progressively harder and weirder.
